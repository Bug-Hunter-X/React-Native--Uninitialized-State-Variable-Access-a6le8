This error occurs when you try to access a state variable in a React Native component before it has been initialized.  This often happens when you try to render the component before the state has fully loaded, leading to undefined values.

```javascript
//Buggy Component
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
};
export default MyComponent; 
```
